AWT and Swing
--------------------------
-->Awt is a basic set of controls, windows and dialog boxes that support a usable but limited graphical interface. 
-->Awt translates its visual components into their corresponding platform specific equivalents.
-->The look and feel of components is defined by the platform not by Java. 
-->Since the awt components use native code resources, awt components are heavyweight.


-->Swing is a set of classes that provides more powerful and flexible GUI components than awt. 
-->The look and feel of swing components is not platform specific. 
-->swing components are called lightweight because they are entirely written java and do not map to platform specific look and feel.
