2Converting applications to applet:
-------------------------------------
Steps:
1. Make an HTML page with the appropriate tag to load the applet code.
2. Supply a subclass of Applet/JApplet class. Make this class public. 
3. Eliminate the main method in the application. Do not construct a frame window for the application. Your applet will be displayed inside the browser.
4. Move any initialization code from the frame window constructor to the init method of the applet.
5. Remove the call to setSize; for applets, sizing is done with the width and height attributes in the HTML file.
6. Remove the call to setDefaultCloseOperation/windowClosing. An applet cannot  be closed it terminates when the browser exits.
7. If the application calls setTitle, eliminate the call to the method. Applets cannot have title bars.
8. Don't call setVisible(true). The applet is displayed automatically.
