 TCP is connection oriented, reliable, slow, provides guaranteed delivery and preserves order of messages, while UDP is connection less, unreliable, no ordering guarantee, but fast protocol. TCP overhead is also much higher than UDP, as it transmits more meta data per packet than UDP. It's worth mentioning that header size of Transmission control protocol is 20 bytes, compared to 8 bytes header of User Datagram protocol. Use TCP, if you can't afford to lose any message, while UDP is better for high speed data transmission, where loss of single packet is acceptable e.g. video streaming or online multi player games.
