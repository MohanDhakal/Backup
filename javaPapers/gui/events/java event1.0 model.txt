Java 1.0 event model
----------------------
-->Not necessary to set up listeners for events.
-->In Java 1.0 there is just one class of events, java.awt.Event. 
-->Every event is generated by a component, which is called the "target" of the event. 
-->The target of an event object, evt, is given by the public instance variable evt.target. 
-->Other instance variables carry other information about various types of events. 
-->For example, the coordinates of a mouse-related event are given by evt.x and evt.y.
-->whenever any event occurs, the system calls a method named handleEvent() in the target component. 
-->For many types of events, handleEvent() will in turn call a special purpose event-handling routine such as mouseDown() or keyDown()
