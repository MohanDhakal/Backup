1. Why java is strongly typed language?
-->Java is a strongly typed programming language because every variable must be declared with a data type. A variable cannot start off life without knowing the range of values it can hold, and once it is declared, the data type of the variable cannot change.

Primitive Types:
-->byte, short, int, long, char, float, double and boolean
Integers: byte, short, int and long
Floating Point: float and double
Character: char
Boolean: boolean

byte: 1 byte	-128 to 127
short: 2 bytes	-32768 to 32767
int: 4 bytes	-2147483648 to 2147483647
long: 8 bytes	-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807

float: 4 bytes	1.4x10 -45 to 3.4x10 38
double: 8 bytes	 4.9x10 -324 to 1.8x10 308

char: 2 bytes   0 to 65536
boolean: true or false value.

Token:
-->A token is the smallest element of a program that is meaningful to the compiler. 
  whitespace, keywords, identifiers, literals, comments, separators(punctuators)
