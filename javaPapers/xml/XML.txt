XML (Extensible Markup Language)
----------------------------------
-->XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format which is both human-readable and machine-readable. 
-->It is defined by the W3C's XML 1.0 Specification.

Characteristics of XML:
--------------------------
-->XML is extensible. (Allows to create self-descriptive tags)
-->XML carries the data, does not present it. (XML allows to store the data and does not bother about how it will be presented)
-->XML is a public standard. (XML was developed by W3C and is available as an open standard.


Why XML?(Importance of XML)
-->Many computer systems contain data in incompatible formats. Exchanging data between incompatible systems (or upgraded systems) is a time-consuming task for web developers. Large amounts of data must be converted, and incompatible data is often lost.

-->XML stores data in plain text format. This provides a software- and hardware-independent way of storing, transporting, and sharing data.

-->XML also makes it easier to expand or upgrade to new operating systems, new applications, or new browsers, without losing data.

-->With XML, data can be available to different kinds of devices like pc, tablets, cell phones etc.
