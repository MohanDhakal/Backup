Java NIO (New Input Output)

--> java.nio is a package that supports a channel based approach to I/O operations.

-->NIO system is built on two fundamental items - buffers and channels
-->A buffer holds the data.
-->A channel represents the open connection to an I/O device such as file or socket.


-->Buffers are defined in java.nio package. All buffers are subclasses of Buffer class. 
-->ByteBuffer, CharBuffer, DoubleBuffer, FloatBuffer, IntBuffer, LongBuffer, ShortBuffer are subclasses of Buffer.


-->Channels are defined in java.nio.channels package. We can obtain a channel by calling a getChannel() on an object that supports channels.
--> DatagramSocket, FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, RandomAccessFile, ServerSocket, Socket classes support channels.
