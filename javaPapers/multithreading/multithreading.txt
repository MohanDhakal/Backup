Multithreading:
--> It is an approach using which a program can do multiple tasks concurrently.
-->Using multithreading a program is divided into multiple threads. Each thread has its own task. 
-->CPU executes one thread at a time.
-->CPU switches between the threads so fast that it seems all threads are executing at the same time.

Multithreading vs Multitasking.
-----------------------------
Multithreading
--------------
-->A thread is the smallest unit.
-->A thread is a light weight task.
-->A thread uses very less memory and CPU resources.
--> All threads share the same address space in memory.
Multitasking:
------------------------
--> A process is the smallest unit.
--> Process is a heavy weight task.
-> A process uses more memory and CPU resources.
-->Each process has its own address space in memory.

Process:It is a program which is in running state. It is a heavy weight task.

Thread: It is a light weight task in a multithreaded program that can perform  one type of task.

Creating a thread:
-------------------
We can create a thread in java:
1. By extending Thread class
2. By implementing Runnable interface
