Session in jsp:
-------------------------
By default JSP have session tracking enabled and a new HttpSession object is instantiated for each new client automatically. Disabling session tracking requires explicitly turning it off as follows:

<%@page session="false" %>

session object is provided by JSP, so without initialization or getSession( ), we can store and retrieve data on session object.
