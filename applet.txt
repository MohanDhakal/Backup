Applet:
-->Applet is a small java program primarily used in Internet computing.
-->An applet can play sounds, display graphics, take user input, play interactive games and so on.

-->An applet which is stored on our computer system and when the browser tries to access the applet, it is not necessary for our computer to be connected to the Internet is called local applet.

--> A remote applet is the one which is not stored in our computer system and we are required to connect to the Internet to access it.

Difference between an applet and a normal java program:
-->Applets do not have a main() method.
-->Applets cannot run independently. They are run from within a browser or
   applet viewer tool is used for testing purpose.
-->Applets cannot read from or write to files on the local computer.
-->Applets are restricted from using libraries of other languages.
-->Applets cannot communicate with other computers on the network.



Applet Life Cycle:
-->The life cycle of an applet is composed of five methods:
init(), start(), paint(), stop(), destroy()

a. init()-->It is the first method to be called. This is where all variables are initialized. This method is called only once during the runtime of applet.

b. start()--> It is called after init(). It is also called to restart an applet after it has been stopped. start() is called each time an applets HTML document is displayed on screen. So, if a user leaves a web page and comes back, the applet resumes execution at start().

c. paint()--> it is called after start(). the paint() method is called each time the applet's output must be redrawn. This method takes one parameter of type Graphics.

d. stop()-->It is called when a user navigates away from the page containing the applet. It is used to suspend the threads that don't need to run when the applet is not visible. We can resume them when start() is called if the user returns to the page.

e. destroy()-->it is called when the HTML document containing the applet is closed by the user. The stop() method is always called before destroy(). 

Applet Skeleton:
-------------------------
-->General structure of applet.
import java.applet.*;
import java.awt.*;
public class MyApplet extends Applet
{
	public void init(){}
	public void start(){}
	public void paint(Graphics g){}
	public void stop(){}
	public void destroy(){}
}

Creating applet:
-----------------
We can create applet in two ways:
1. By extending Applet class of java.applet package
2. By extending JApplet class of javax.swing package
