Exception Handling:
--------------------
Errors
-------
-->Errors are the mistakes in a program that prevent the normal execution of a program.
-->Errors can be:
a. syntax errors:- These are the errors which are detected by the compiler. Spelling mistakes, missing semicolon come under this category.

   For eg. public static void main(String args)
	   {
		system.out.println("Hello)
	   }

b. Logical errors:- These are the errors which are not detected by the compiler.
-->These are the errors in the logic of programmer.
-->During runtime, we get different result.

for eg. we have to print 1  4  9  16 .....100
   and the code
	for(int i=1;i<=100;i++)
	   System.out.print(i*i);

c. Runtime errors:- These are the errors which are not detected by the compiler.
-->During program execution time, these errors terminate the running program. 
  For eg. dividing a number by zero, using the array index that does not exist etc.
