Dialog Box:
-------------
--> A dialog box is a window similar to frame however, it does not 
contain menu bar and it cannot run independently.

--> We use the class JDialog.
--> Its constructors are:

	a. JDialog(JFrame parent,boolean isModal)
	b. JDialog(JFrame parent,String title, boolean isModal)

Types of Dialog Box:
-----------------------------
a. Modal Dialog Box: It is a type of dialog box which does not allow to access other parts of application until it is closed. We set the value "true" for isModal in the constructor to make a modal dialog box.

b. Non-Modal Dialog Box:- It is a type of dialog box which allows to 
access other parts of application before it is closed. We set the value "false" for isModal in the constructor to make a non-modal dialog box.
