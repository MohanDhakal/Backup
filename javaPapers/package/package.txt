Package
---------
-->A package is a collection of classes and interfaces.
-->The advantage of using package is that we can easily use the classes of one package into another package simply by importing them. Also, a package helps us to group related classes into one location.

Types of Package:
----------------------
1. Library/Built-In Package: These are the packages which are already available in java library.
These are of two types:
a. Core Package:- start with java. For eg. java.io,java.lang, java.util etc.

b. Optional Package:- start with javax. For eg. javax.swing, javax.servlet, javax.servlet.http etc

2. User Defined Package: These are the package which are created by user according to their need.

Creating User Defined Package:
-------------------------------
"package" keyword is used. 
For eg. package mypack; 
Note: 
* package must be the first statement in a java program except comments.
* We can also create package hierarchy like
  package mypack.day1;    

Program to create our own package and importing it:
----------------------------------------------------

package mypack1;
public class Test
{
	public void show()
	{
	   System.out.println("Inside test");
	}
}
