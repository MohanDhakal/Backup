Synchronization:
--------------------------
--> When two or more threads need a shared resource, there must be a way to ensure that only one thread can use the resource at a time.
--> The process by which it is achieved is called synchronization.
--> Key to synchronization is the concept of a "monitor".
--> A monitor is an object that acts as a mutually exclusive     lock.
--> When a thread is using the "monitor", other all threads     need to wait until the "monitor" is released.
--> In java all objects have a "monitor" associated with  them. We just need to call a "synchronized method" to get a monitor.

In java synchronization can be achieved:
a. By using synchronized method.
b. By using synchronized block/statement.
