JSP: Java Server Pages
----------------------------
Advantage Of JSP Technology:
-->Faster loading of pages.
-->Nobody can borrow the code.
-->No browser compatibility issues
-->Supported by a number of web servers.

Comparison:
JSP Vs Servlet
-->Since JSP get automatically translated into Java Servlets, hence there is no difference between what can be done by a servlet or JSP.
-->Both JSP and servlet are executed by a JVM.
-->The distinct advantage of JSP over servlets is that JSP allows a logical division between what is displayed and the server side code. 
It is easy to modify the look and feel of what is delivered by a JSP without having to alter any server side code.
-->While it is true that anything done with a JSP can also be done using servlet, JSP provide a nice clean separation of the application's presentation layer from its data manipulation layer.



Comparison:
ASP Vs JSP
-->ASP are not platform independent while JSP are platform independent.
--> ASP use Active X components while JSP use Java Beans technology.
-->JSP are compiled the first time they are requested leading to faster page loading for subsequent requests, while ASP have to be translated each and every time and leads to slower page loading.
-->ASP works only with Microsoft's IIS web server. JSP is available on any Web Server.


JSP implicit objects:
