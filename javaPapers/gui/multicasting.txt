Multicasting in event handling:
-----------------------------
-->When an event occurs, all the registered listeners are notified and receive a copy of the event object.
This process is called multicasting.

-->It has the major benefit in java that we don't need to override the method defined inside a particular listener interface for the similar components separately. 
-->For example to handle the action event generated by buttons in a program we can override a single actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)method and check from which button is the event generated by using getSource() method
