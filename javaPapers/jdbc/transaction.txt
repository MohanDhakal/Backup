Transaction:
---------------------
A set of statements can be grouped to form a transaction. If everything goes well, transaction can be committed. In case of error, it can be rolled back.

By default, a database connection is in autocommit mode and each SQL statement is committed to the database as soon as it is executed. Once it is committed, we cannot roll it back. 

We can turn off autocommit mode for using transaction.

con.setAutoCommit(false);
Statement st=con.createStatement();
st.executeUpdate(command1);
st.executeUpdate(command2);
.....
con.commit();
-----------------------
In case of SQLException we can rollback:
con.rollback();
