File Handling:
-------------------------

-->The process of writing data to a persistent store i.e file and reading the data from the file.
-->Java uses the concept of stream in file handling.
-->A stream is a logical entity that connects to a physical device. It either produces or consumes information.

-->Java supports two types of streams for file handling.
a. Byte stream: used for handling of data in the form of bytes. It does not support unicode characters. InputStream and OutputStream are the top level byte stream classes for reading and writing to file.


b. Character stream: used for handling of data in the form of characters. Supports the unicode characters.Reader and Writer are the top level character stream classes for reading and writing to file.

Programs: 1.Read/Write using byte stream
	  2. Read/Write using character stream
          3. Read/Write Mixed data
          4. Read/Write using Random Access File
          5. Read/Write objects

Writing to file using Byte Stream:      
-->FileOutputStream subclass of OutputStream is used.    
Reading from file using Byte Stream: 
-->FileInputStream subclass of InputStream is used. 

To Do:
-->Create a program to copy the contents of "d:/test.txt" into "e:/test.txt" using byte stream.

Writing to file using character stream:
-->FileWriter subclass of Writer is used.
Reading from file using character stream:
-->FileReader subclass of Reader is used.

To DO:
-->Create a program to copy the contents of "d:/test2.txt" into "e:/test2.txt" using character stream.
