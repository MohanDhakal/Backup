Event Handling:
-----------------------

Event Delegation Model (Delegation Event Model)
-----------------------------------------------
-->It is an approach in event handling in which a component generates an event and notifies the event listener for further processing.
-->This approach is based on:
 
a. Event: --> It is an object that specifies the state change in a component. For eg. Clicking a button, selecting item in a drop down box etc.

b. Event Source:--> It is the component that generates event. For eg. Button is event source when it is clicked.

c. Event Listener:-> It is an interface that is notified by the event source after the event source generates any event. 

Note: -->1 event source may generate many events. For eg. a TextField can generate ActionEvent, KeyEvent or FocusEvent.
-->Many event sources may generate one event. For eg. Button, TextField, MenuItem generate ActionEvent.
-->Event means class and Event Listener means interface. Both of these are defined in java.awt.event package or javax.swing.event package.
