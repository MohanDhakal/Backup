Thread Priority:
------------------------
--> A thread priority is a number between 1 to 10 that represents priority of a thread.
--> setPriority(int priority) can be used to set the priority of a thread. 
--> priority can be integer value (1 to 10) or any of these constants:
		Thread.MIN_PRIORITY
		Thread.MAX_PRIORITY
		Thread.NORM_PRIORITY
-->getPriority() is used to return an integer that represents the priority of given thread.
--> Note: It does not mean that higher priority thread will finish first than lower priority thread. It only means that CPU will switch to the higher priority thread most often.
--> By default all threads have a normal priority.
