A JSP that displays how many times it has been accessed

<html>
<body>
The page count is:
<%
out.println(Counter.getCount());
%>
</body>
</html>

-------------------------------------------

package mypack;
public class Counter{
   private static int count;
   public static int getCount( ){
        count++;
         return count;
     }
}

----------------------------------------------

we get error Counter class is not recognized. To solve this problem:

solution 1: mypack.Counter.getCount( )

solution 2:
<%@ page import="mypack.*" %>
<html>
<body>
The page count is:
<%
out.println(Counter.getCount());
%>
</body>
</html>
 ----------------------------------------------------------------

To import multiple packages:
<%@ page import="java.util.*, java.net.*" %>

Directive: A directive is a way to give special instructions to the Container at page translation time. They do not produce any output that is visible to the client. 
The directives are characterized using <%@    %> tags.
Following are the directives available in JSP:
a. page --> The page directive allows importing classes, setting content type and so on. It can be placed anywhere within the document.
b. include-->The include directive is used to include HTML file, JSP or servlet into a JSP file. Usually the included files are for tables, headers and footers.
c. taglib-->The taglib directive allows the page to use custom tags inside the JSP page.

JSP comments:
<%//single line comment %>  
<%-- single line comment --%>
<%/*multi 
         line comment  */%>

Scriptlet: <%    %> whatever java code is written inside this tag.
Expression: <%= %>whatever java code is written inside this tag.

Note: in JSP we can remove out.println by using expression.






for eg in above jsp page:
<%= Counter.getCount( ) %> can be done.
Notice that there is no semicolon in an expression.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Declaring a variable:
a. In a scriptlet:
<% int count=0; %>  here count becomes a local variable
b. In a declaration:
<%! int count=0; %> 
-->declarations are for static and instance variables and methods.



************************************************

<html>
<body>
<%@ include file="include.txt" %>
