Sandbox Security:
-------------------------
-->Whenever code is loaded from a remote site and then executed locally, security becomes vital.
-->Visiting a webpage automatically starts all applets on the page.
-->If clicking a link or visiting a page could install arbitary code on the user's computer, there would be a great chance of losing confidential information.
-->To prevent it, Java uses a security model "Sandbox security model" to allow only those operations that are harmless.
--> To allow additional operations, the code must be digitally signed and the user must approve the signing certificate.
--> Programs in "sandbox security model" have the following restrictions:
1. They can never run any local executable program.
2. They cannot read from or write to the local computer's file system.
3. They cannot find out any information about the local computer, except for the Java version used and a few harmless operating system details.
4. Remotely loaded programs need user consent to communicate with any host other than the server from which they were downloaded.
5. All pop-up windows carry a warning message. This message is a security feature to ensure that users do not mistake the window for a local application.
