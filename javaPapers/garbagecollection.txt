Java Garbage Collection
-----------------------------
In java, garbage means unreferenced objects.
Garbage Collection is process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory automatically. In other words, it is a way to destroy the unused objects.

Advantage of Garbage Collection:
---------------------------------
It makes java memory efficient because garbage collector removes the unreferenced objects from heap memory.
It is automatically done by the garbage collector(a part of JVM) so we don't need to make extra efforts.


finalize() method
--------------------------
The finalize() method is invoked each time before the object is garbage collected. This method can be used to perform cleanup processing. This method is defined in Object class as:

protected void finalize(){}


gc() method
--------------------------
The gc() method is used to invoke the garbage collector to perform cleanup processing. The gc() is found in System and Runtime classes.

public static void gc(){}  



Simple Example of garbage collection in java

public class TestGarbage1{  
 public void finalize(){ 
	System.out.println("object is garbage collected");
 }  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
  	TestGarbage1 s1=new TestGarbage1();  
  	TestGarbage1 s2=new TestGarbage1();  
  	s1=null;  
  	s2=null;  
  	System.gc();  
  }  
}  

------------------
Note: Neither finalization nor garbage collection is guaranteed.
