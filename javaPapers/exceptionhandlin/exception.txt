Exception:
-----------
-->Exception are the runtime errors which terminate the running program if not handled.
-->In java, exception is an object that represents an exceptional condition has arised during runtime.
-->The process of handling exception in order to prevent sudden termination of program is called exception handling.
-->Five keywords can be used for handling exceptions:
   try, catch, finally, throw, throws

Types of exception:
--------------------
1. Checked Exception:
   These are the exception that are checked by the compiler. If our program uses the code that might generate checked exception, we must use exception handling technique in our program otherwise our program can't be executed. IOException, SQLException etc are checked exceptions.
2. Unchecked Exception:
   These are the exception that are not checked by the compiler. We can run the program, however, during program execution, if these exceptions occur, program gets terminated. ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException are unchecked exceptions.

Uses of :
--------
try --> used to enclose the statements which might generate exception.
catch --> used to hold the exception thrown from the try           block
finally --> used to ensure that the statements written         inside this block get executed 100% sure whether         exception occurs or not.
throw   --> used to explicitly throw an exception object
throws --> used to inform the users that a method throws exception and hence use exception handling mechanism.
